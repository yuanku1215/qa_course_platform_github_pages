          "question": "A system can be turned on or off. When it is on, its production level must be between 10 and 50. When it is off, production must be zero. Define appropriate decision variables and constraints.",
          "answer": "Let y ∈ {0,1} indicate on/off status and x ≥ 0 be production. Constraints: 10y ≤ x ≤ 50y.",
          "explain": "The binary variable y activates or deactivates the feasible range of x. This is a standard on–off modeling pattern."

          "explain": "A problem is dynamic when decisions influence future states, not merely when parameters change over time."

          "question": "True or False: If two decisions interact, their effects cannot be represented by simply summing independent costs.",

          "question": "What is the main difficulty of multi-objective optimization problems?\n(A) No feasible solutions exist\n(B) Objectives cannot be quantified\n(C) There is no single unique optimal solution\n(D) Constraints are too complex",
          "answer": "C",
          "explain": "Multi-objective problems typically result in a set of Pareto-optimal solutions rather than a single optimum."
