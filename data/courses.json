          "question": "A system can be turned on or off. When it is on, its production level must be between 10 and 50. When it is off, production must be zero. Define appropriate decision variables and constraints.",
          "answer": "Let y ∈ {0,1} indicate on/off status and x ≥ 0 be production. Constraints: 10y ≤ x ≤ 50y.",
          "explain": "The binary variable y activates or deactivates the feasible range of x. This is a standard on–off modeling pattern."
